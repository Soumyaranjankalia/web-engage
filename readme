Subject: Request for Extension on Task Delivery Due to Family Emergency

Dear Sir / Ma'am,

I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to inform you that I am facing a family emergency and will not be able to meet the expected delivery date for the task assigned to me, which was due tomorrow.

Due to this unforeseen situation, I am requesting an extension of three days to complete the task to the best of my abilities. I understand the importance of meeting deadlines and I assure you that I will work diligently to get the task done as soon as possible.

I apologize for any inconvenience this may cause and I would appreciate your understanding in this matter. Please let me know if you require any further information or clarification.

Thank you for your prompt attention to this matter.

Best regards,
Soumya Ranjan kalia
